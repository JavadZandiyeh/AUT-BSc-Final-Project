# Bachelor's Final Project
Here are the steps and useful documents I utilized in my bachelor's final project at Amirkabir University of Technology.

## Project Description
### Subject
> ***Fairness in Graph Neural Networks-Based Recommender Systems***
### Abstract
> As Recommender Systems increasingly play a pivotal role in shaping user experiences and preferences, concerns about fairness in their recommendations have gained prominence. This project investigates the concept of fairness in the context of Graph Neural Network (GNN) based Recommender Systems, recognizing the inherent complexities introduced by graph-structured data. Leveraging principles from fairness-aware machine learning, we scrutinize the potential biases that may arise in user recommendations and explore methodologies to mitigate such biases within the GNN framework. Our research aims to contribute insights into developing more equitable and unbiased recommender systems, addressing the challenges posed by diverse user preferences and intricate network structures. Through empirical evaluations and experiments on real-world datasets, we assess the effectiveness of proposed fairness-enhancing techniques in GNN-based Recommender Systems, shedding light on the intricate interplay between fairness considerations and the unique characteristics of graph-structured data. This work underscores the importance of prioritizing fairness in the design and implementation of recommender systems, paving the way for more inclusive and unbiased content recommendations in diverse online environments.
